The Code Snippets and the Data Used in the Thesis Model

This repository on Github is formed with the intention of providing the interested parties with the R code snippets and the data used in my Master's Thesis titled "Revisiting Goyal and Welch: New Insights into Equity Premium Prediction Models, and the Significance of Sentiment". 

The code was based on an attempt performed by Daniel Amy to replicate the findings of Goyal and Welch's 2008
paper, titled "A Comprehensive Look at the Empirical Performance of Equity Premium Prediction". His Github
repository is accessible via the following public link:

Please feel free to reach out for any questions, comments or suggestions.
